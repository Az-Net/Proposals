In recent years, the field of occultism and esoteric knowledge has gained renewed interest and attention, as individuals seek guidance, insight, and inspiration from practices that are often considered outside the mainstream. Throughout history, many famous and powerful individuals have turned to advisors, consultants, or practitioners of the occult for various reasons, ranging from political guidance to artistic inspiration. 

From Queen Elizabeth I's association with John Dee in the 16th century, to Winston Churchill's interest in astrology in the 20th century, to modern examples such as Jay-Z's association with Maria Abramovic, these historical examples highlight the longstanding tradition of seeking esoteric knowledge in influential circles. 

This paper argues for the acceptance of occultism and esoteric practices as a legitimate profession in modern times, acknowledging the historical significance and continued relevance of these practices in contemporary society, and acknowledging a set of standards and practices must be maintained to prevent the rampant spread of charlatan practitioners. 

By examining the historical and modern examples of influential individuals employing occult advisors, we can understand the role of occultism in shaping human beliefs, behaviors, and decision-making processes, and recognize the potential value and impact of this field in today's world.

It's important to note that the extent to which these individuals relied on or believed in the occult or esoteric knowledge of their advisors may vary, and these associations may be subject to different interpretations and perspectives. The field of occultism and esoteric knowledge is often controversial and subjective, and beliefs and practices associated with it can vary widely. 

Queen Elizabeth I (1533-1603) and John Dee (1527-1608): Queen Elizabeth I of England, known for her illustrious reign during the Elizabethan Era, is often associated with her advisor, John Dee, who was a prominent occultist, mathematician, and astrologer. 
Dee was known for his expertise in various occult practices, including divination, alchemy, and communication with angels. He served as an advisor to Queen Elizabeth I, providing her with counsel on matters of state, including political, religious, and military affairs. It is believed that Dee's knowledge and guidance influenced Elizabeth's decision-making and policies, and that he played a significant role in shaping the course of English history during her reign. 
The relationship between Queen Elizabeth I and John Dee is often regarded as an example of a powerful monarch seeking counsel from a renowned occultist, highlighting the historical significance of occult and esoteric practices in the realms of politics and power during that era. 

The historical examples of famous and powerful individuals employing occult advisors highlight the diverse and longstanding presence of occultism and esoteric knowledge in human history. These examples illustrate that seeking guidance and insights from practitioners of the occult is not a phenomenon limited to a specific era or culture, but rather a universal aspect of human behavior. Despite its controversial and often misunderstood nature, occultism has played a significant role in shaping the beliefs, decisions, and actions of influential individuals and society as a whole. 

Furthermore, in modern times, the acceptance of occultism and esoteric practices as a legitimate profession can be seen as part of the evolving landscape of human spirituality and the increasing recognition of diverse belief systems. Just as people seek guidance from other established professions, such as psychologists, counselors, or consultants, individuals may also seek advice and assistance from professional occult practitioners for their unique perspectives and insights. 

It is important to acknowledge that occultism, like any other profession, is subject to ethical considerations, and individuals who claim to be practitioners of the occult should adhere to ethical standards and practices. However, by recognizing the historical significance, cultural relevance, and potential value of occultism in contemporary society, we can foster a more inclusive and nuanced understanding of this field. 

In conclusion, the acceptance of occultism and esoteric practices as a legitimate profession in modern times can be viewed as a reflection of the dynamic nature of human beliefs and practices, and the need for diverse perspectives in addressing complex questions and challenges. By embracing the historical examples of famous individuals who have employed occult advisors and acknowledging the role of occultism in shaping human history, we can open up meaningful conversations and promote a more inclusive and accepting approach towards our respectivefields in the present day.
