It is important to distinguish between the popular perception of 'magic' as a realm of illusions and supernatural powers and the deeper understanding of 'magick' as a study of subjectivity and the manipulation of consciousness.

While there are certainly elements of magick that fall into the realm of performance and illusion, true magick goes beyond trickery or the attainment of fantastical abilities. It delves into the profound depths of human consciousness, exploring the power of intention, symbolism, and ritual to shape our perceptions and experiences.

In a sense, magick can be considered the science of subjectivity, complementing the objective study of the physical world through the exploration of the inner realm of consciousness. Magick seeks to understand the subjective experiences of individuals and how these experiences shape their interactions with the world around them.

Through various techniques, such as meditation, visualization, and ritual, magick practitioners aim to cultivate self-awareness, enhance personal power, and influence their subjective experiences. This can manifest in various ways, such as improving focus, fostering creativity, or cultivating a sense of peace and well-being.

Just as science seeks to understand and manipulate the physical world through objective observation and experimentation, magick seeks to understand and manipulate the subjective world through introspection and intention. It is a journey of self-discovery, empowering individuals to harness the power of their own consciousness to create positive change in their lives and the world around them.

It is crucial to approach magick with a respectful and mindful attitude, recognizing the potential for both positive and negative outcomes. As with any powerful tool, magick should be used responsibly and ethically, with a focus on personal growth, self-understanding, and the betterment of society.

# The Occult Tradition in Fiction: An explanation of terms Occultists Have Used in Fiction to Hide Their Truths

**Occultists have used fiction to hide their truths for centuries.**

In the Dark Ages, occultists were often burned at the stake as heretics. In the Renaissance, they were persecuted by the Inquisition. And in the modern era, they are often dismissed as charlatans or the mentally ill.

But occultists have always found ways to preserve their knowledge and traditions. One way they have done this is by hiding their truths within fiction.

Novels, short stories, and films have provided a safe space for occultists to explore their ideas and share their knowledge with others. By couching their truths in the language of fiction, occultists have been able to avoid persecution and censorship.

For example, the author of *The Wizard of Oz*, L. Frank Baum, was a member of the Theosophical Society. Theosophy is a system of thought that combines elements of Eastern and Western religions, philosophy, and science.

Baum's ideas about Theosophy are interwoven into the *Wizard of Oz*. For example, the Yellow Brick Road represents the path to enlightenment, the four witches represent the four classical elements, The Emerald City represents the spiritual realm, and the Wizard himself represents the divine spark that exists within each of us, the unseen clockwork at play manifesting our existence.

 There are many other examples, such as the works of Aleister Crowley and H.P. Lovecraft.

The use of fiction as a way to hide occult truths is a long and complex tradition. It is a tradition that continues to this day. And it is a tradition that is essential to the survival of occult knowledge.

# The Paradigm of [White Wolf Publishing](https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page);

The Tellurian is the whole of reality.

A tellurian is a mechanical model for demonstrating the rotation and orbit of the Earth. Mages use this as a metaphor for all Reality -- what is, what was, what will be (or might be), even what could be. This raw potential takes shape in the Tapestry, but a mage can re-weave parts of this by drawing on the infinite possibilities of the Tellurian.

The Tapestry is the concept of the world as a whole, before it was fragmented.
Today, the Tapestry is divided.

Mages are formed during a process referred to as the Awakening. Each Awakening is unique, and what triggers it is yet unexplored. Mages are usually drawn into the Supernal through their own obsessions with Mysteries that reveal to them a way through the Lie. On their way, they establish a symbolic connection to the realm they awakened to.

The 10 Arcana are thought of as threads that created the known worlds. Only by understanding the threads can one weave them into Patterns of his own devising. 
We also ponder the reasons behind our art. 
We know with certainty that there is more to reality than what meets the common eye, and there is more than one state of existence beyond the material. 
Behind the many forms and shapes of things, the world is, in fact, One: heaven and earth together in a single continuum. Subtle veils divided the realms and states of being from one another, separating high from low and creating the illusion of division. Through Ascension, you are able to transcend this illusion and become a being of all Realms by returning to the supernal fires that created everything.

Ascension is the process of translating the very [soul](https://github.com/Az-Net/Proposals/blob/main/Defining%20Soul.md) and being of an individual into the Supernal Realms. To most, this is achieved by unlocking the Final Key of the Golden Road and allowing your individual essence to become pure Truth. 
Each individual has unique Omens - specific goals in the Golden Road Ascension, that changes what they are attempting to make into a reality. Their goal is in order to achieve their Noumenon - an Image of their Ascension. An ascended mage is ultimately and by all means immortal, as they effectively exist as a symbol.

Magic is the power to impose one's will onto reality and is divided into ten Arcana. These are Death, Fate, Forces, Life, Matter, Mind, Prime, Space, Spirit, and Time. Each Path has two Ruling Arcana and one Inferior Arcanum. As mages develop their Arcana, they gain special attainments that show their growing power, transforming them. The total advancement of an individual's understanding is referred to as Paradigm.

As awakened grow into their role, they find that they are constantly aware of the underlying symbolism of the Supernal within the world. This is referred to as Insight.

Under Insight, Awakened see Supernal symbols in the world around them. From studying and deciphering these symbols, mages grow in power. Mages hunt Mysteries in order to further their own understanding and gain insights into the cosmos. The process of hunting down a mystery is often called a "Mystery Play", reminiscent of the first Mystery that every Awakened encountered - that of their own Awakening.

The Tapestry is vast, and filled with Mysteries great and small. Spells and other alterations always leave behind small telltale signs that are visible for those who can tap into their insight. Although many mysteries have direct, obvious connections to the Supernal, most do not. Nothing external forces a mage to pursue the Mysteries, and those who do not have a natural curiosity and a willingness to go to great lengths to satisfy their internal calling simply do not Awaken. Some mages, especially those with low Wisdom, become obsessed with certain Mysteries, going to great and morally questionable lengths to decipher them.

The Consensus is the term used by mages to refer to the overriding consensual reality created by the beliefs of 'Sleepers'.

Mages know that all humans shape the world with their wills, but Sleepers do so unconsciously - reality is what the majority of people believe it to be. For any individual willworker to work magic, he must force his belief on the world, fighting the billions of minds whose beliefs shape the Consensus. Subtle or coincidental magic seeks to act in tune with the paradigm established by the Consensus, and is thus easier than obviously unnatural vulgar magic as portrayed in fiction. When a mage contradicts the Consensus, it fights back in the form of Paradox.


In the modern age, beliefs of Sleepers create a much more static and ordered Consensus based on science and reason, rather than the mystical unknown our ancestors experienced. The original Order of Reason sought this outcome for altruistic reasons, fearing the power the supernatural held over common folk. 

Paradox is the collective force of consensual reality fighting back against the enlightened will of an individual.

A useful analogy is to imagine the Tellurian as a huge body of water. Most people move with the currents of reality, floating along on a cushion of their own belief. Some of these people, sleepers or simply the heroically lucky, learn to dip their hands in and alter the flow, but they cannot redirect the river. Some individuals are predators, fast and agile in the waters of reality, but still confined by the flow of belief. The Mage, however, sees the river for what it is, and can push the water around as they choose.

Paradox is the inertia of 6 million gallons of belief. Mages who attempt to change reality with vulgar magic are pushing the river in ways it does not want to go, and risk being drowned by the current. Coincidental magic uses the flow of reality, rather than fighting against it, and can easily avoid Paradox.

Practically, Paradox is the only thing that stands between a Mage and ruling the world. The world is a dark and unbelieving place, and most mortals cannot or will not accept anything outside of their normal expectations. The collective belief of humans has a powerful effect on reality.

Paradox can take a variety of forms. Backlash, reality directly attacking the offensive mage, can cause temporary, long term, or even permanent wounds, flaws, or oddities. 
Quiet, a magical form of madness, forces the offending mage to resolve their guilt over disjointing reality.
Cognitive Dissonance is a result of paradox reflected in sleepers, whose pre-patterned mindsets cause them to deny the existence of your reality, subjugating yours to theirs.

Much like the river, the consensus can be moved over time, making vulgar effects coincidental, or even mundane. The Order of Reason has had much success over the last 800 years convincing sleepers to accept their view of reality.

Mages in the Dark Ages only had to deal with Backlash, a chance that their magicks would fail disastrously when performed poorly.

By the Renaissance, this Backlash had become a Scourge which reacted according to the beliefs of the local populace. Sometimes the Scourge would help the casting mage, sometimes it would hinder.

At the Battle of Naseby on June 14, 1645 CE, Scourge changed forever. Due to the high levels of vulgar magic being used at the time, the Scourge became a purely negative force, punishing any mage who used too much vulgar magic. It became Paradox.
