I think, therefore I do.  
I do, therefore I create.  
I create, therefore I destroy.  
I destroy, therefore I feel.  
I feel, therefore I am.  
I exist, and I seek to maintain balance. 


This philosophy suggests that thinking and doing are not separate entities, but rather two sides of the same coin. When we think, we are already creating, and when we create, we are already destroying. This destruction is not necessarily negative, however. It can be seen as a necessary part of the creative process, as it allows us to make way for new things.

The feeling that comes from destruction is often one of sadness or loss. However, it can also be a feeling of renewal and hope. When we destroy something, we are also freeing ourselves from it. We are allowing ourselves to move on to new things.

In the end, the balance that we seek is not between thinking and doing, or between creating and destroying. It is between the positive and negative aspects of both. When we can embrace both sides of the coin, we can find true fulfillment.

This philosophy is also reminiscent of the Taoist concept of yin and yang. Yin and yang are two opposing forces that are constantly in balance. Yin represents the feminine, dark, and passive aspects of the universe, while yang represents the masculine, light, and active aspects. The two forces are always in flux, and their balance is essential for the universe to function properly.

In the same way, our own thoughts, actions, and emotions are constantly in flux. We need to find a balance between the different aspects of our being in order to live a fulfilling life. When we can embrace both the positive and negative aspects of ourselves, we can achieve true harmony.
