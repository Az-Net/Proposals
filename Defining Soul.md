## Soul

## Egyptian Conceptualization of the Soul; in Jungian Terms

## AHK
The Ahk is what the human soul looked like, according to the ancient egyptians.  
The depiction below uses modern interpretations of their art.  



* The Scarab represents Khet.  
* The Pillar of Djed represents the Ib.   
* The Solar Disk of Ra and Lunar Disk of Konsu represents the Sah.  
* The Uraeus surrounding the solar disk represents the protection of Ra by Mehen.  
* The Wings of Ma'at represents the Ba.  
* The Cartouche represents the Ren.  
* The spiral above is the heiroglyph that says 'Heh' when spoken aloud; the sound of an exhaled breath. It represents the lifeforce of the universe being breathed into the Ren.  
* The raised-up arms represent the Ka. Combined with Heh, it makes Heka.  
* The shadow hidden in the background represents the Shut.  
 
* The Eyes of Horus above represents Sekhem.  
  
Ahk = (Khet + Ren) Sah / (Ib + Ba) = Sekhem  
Ka was already there.  
Shut formed in the last moments of creation as a reflection of the True Self.  
The H is what started it all.  
  


The equation Ahk = (Khet + Ren) Sah / (Ib + Ba) = Sekhem is a way of understanding the different parts of the Egyptian conceptualization of the soul from a mathematical perspective.

* **Akh** is the overall soul, or the sum of the parts.
* **Khet** is the physical body.
* **Ren** is the name, which was seen as an important part of the soul.
* **Sah** is the mind, or the seat of consciousness.
* **Ib** is the heart, or the seat of emotions and intuition.
* **Ba** is the personality, or the outward expression of the soul.
* **Sekhem** is the power or energy of the soul.

The equation can be interpreted in a few different ways. One way is to see it as a way of understanding the different aspects of the soul and how they interact with each other. For example, the Khet (body) provides the foundation for the Ren (name), which in turn provides the foundation for the Sah (mind). The Ib (heart) and Ba (personality) are then the outward expressions of the Sah (mind).

Another way to interpret the equation is to see it as a way of understanding the journey of the soul. The Khet (body) is the starting point, and the Ren (name) is the goal. The Sah (mind) is the journey itself, and the Ib (heart) and Ba (personality) are the challenges and obstacles that we face along the way.

The Sekhem (power or energy of the soul) is the force that drives us forward on our journey. It is the spark of life that animates us and gives us the will to continue.

The equation is a complex and nuanced way of understanding the Egyptian conceptualization of the soul. It is a reminder that the soul is not just a physical entity, but also a spiritual one. It is a journey, a process, and a force of nature.
