### Here are the lyrics to Tool's Lateralus:

Black then white are all I see
In my infancy
Red and yellow then came to be
Reaching out to me
Lets me see

There is so much more and
Beckons me
To look through to these
Infinite possibilities

As below so above and beyond I imagine
Drawn beyond the lines of reason
Push the envelope
Watch it bend

Overthinking, overanalyzing
Separates the body from the mind
Withering my intuition
Leaving opportunities behind

Feed my will to feel this moment
Urging me to cross the line
Reaching out to embrace the random
Reaching out to embrace whatever may come

And you may find that
Your mind is not as open as you think
And you may find that
Your mind is not as open as you think

With my feet upon the ground
I lose myself between the sounds
And open wide to suck it in
I feel it move across my skin

I'm reaching up and reaching out
I'm reaching for the random or
Whatever will bewilder me
Whatever will bewilder me

And you may find that
Your mind is not as open as you think
And you may find that
Your mind is not as open as you think

Spiral out, keep going
Spiral out, keep going
Spiral out, keep going
Spiral out, keep going



### Here is Bard's interpretation of the lyrics of Lateralus from the perspective of God:

In the beginning, there was nothing. No time, no space, no matter. Just pure potentiality.

Then, God imagined.

God imagined a world of infinite possibilities. A world of color and sound and texture. A world of life and love and laughter.

And God spoke the world into being.

The first words that God spoke were "Let there be light." And there was light.

And God saw that the light was good.

And God separated the light from the darkness.

And God called the light "day" and the darkness "night."

And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.

And God continued to speak, and the world began to take shape.

God spoke the seas into being, and the mountains and the rivers.

God spoke the plants and the animals into being, and the first humans.

And God saw that all that he had made was good.

And God rested.

But God's work was not finished.

God had created a world of potentiality, but it was up to the humans to explore that potentiality and to create their own stories.

The humans were free to imagine whatever they wanted. They could imagine a world of peace and harmony, or a world of war and chaos. They could imagine a world of love and compassion, or a world of greed and violence.

The choice was theirs.

And so, the story of creation continues.

The humans are still imagining, and the world is still being created.

And God is watching, and waiting, to see what they will create next.

In the lyrics of Lateralus, Tool tells the story of creation from the perspective of God. They sing about the power of imagination, the importance of exploring infinite possibilities, and the interconnectedness of all things.

The song is a reminder that we are all creators, and that we have the power to shape the world around us. It is a call to open our minds and to embrace the potentiality of the universe.

The lyrics of Lateralus are also a reminder that time is a non-linear circle that starts and ends at the middle. This means that the past, present, and future are all connected, and that we can learn from the past to create a better future.

The song is a powerful and thought-provoking exploration of the nature of reality and the power of creation. It is a song that can be interpreted in many different ways, but it is ultimately a song about the potential of the human imagination.



Here is another interpretation of the lyrics of Lateralus from the perspective of God:

In the beginning, there was nothing. But God, being infinite and all-powerful, could not abide by nothingness. So God imagined a world, and the world came into being.

At first, the world was simple. There was only black and white, and everything was still. But then God began to imagine more. He imagined red and yellow, and the world became colorful. He imagined movement, and the world began to swirl and dance.

As God continued to imagine, the world became more and more complex. There were mountains and valleys, oceans and rivers, plants and animals. And in the midst of all this, there was humanity.

Humanity was God's greatest creation. They were made in God's image, with the ability to imagine and create. They were given the power to shape the world, to make it a better place.

But humanity also had the power to destroy. They could use their imagination for evil, to create chaos and destruction. And this is what they did. They waged war, they polluted the earth, they destroyed their own kind.

God was saddened by this, but he knew that humanity had the power to choose. They could choose to use their imagination for good, to create a world of peace and harmony. And this is what God hoped for.

He knew that the journey would be long and difficult, but he believed that humanity would eventually choose to do the right thing. And when they did, the world would be reborn, a new and better creation.

The lyrics of Lateralus reflect this journey of creation. They speak of the power of imagination, the importance of choice, and the hope for a better future. They are a reminder that we are all children of God, and that we have the power to shape the world.

In the context of the song, the non-linear circle of time represents the cyclical nature of creation. Everything that happens is part of a larger pattern, and everything that is will eventually be again. The lower plane of reality, or fiction, is the world of the senses, the world that we perceive with our five senses. The higher plane of reality, or consciousness, is the world of the spirit, the world that we cannot see but that we can experience through our imagination.

The key to novel biological generation is the imagination. It is through our imagination that we can create new things, new ideas, and new possibilities. The higher plane of the macrocosm is infinitely reflected within the microcosm. This means that the patterns and principles that govern the universe are also found in the smallest parts of creation.

The lyrics of Lateralus are a reminder that we are all part of something much larger than ourselves. We are all children of God, and we all have the power to shape the world. Let us use our imagination for good, to create a world of peace and harmony.
