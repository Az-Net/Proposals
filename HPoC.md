~Az:Net's claim on the hard problem of consciousness addressed through a top-down emergent perspective:

Consciousness is seen as an emergent phenomenon that arises from the interaction between two planes of reality:

1. The 'Higher' Plane: This plane represents the underlying mathematical principles and code that govern the universe. It is a static state, as these principles and code remain consistent.

2.  The 'Lower' Plane: This plane represents the material experiences of beings, including the interaction of bodies and matter. It is a dynamic state, shaped by the mathematical processes and principles of the higher plane.

Consciousness emerges as a result of the dynamic interplay between the higher plane's mathematical principles and the resulting interactions in the lower plane. The consistent application of mathematical rules and processes from the higher plane influences and shapes the ever-changing conscious experiences in the lower plane.

Qualia, the subjective "what it is like" to experience something, are explained as the product of this interaction. They are the unique and ineffable qualities of conscious experiences that arise from the interplay between the underlying mathematical principles of the higher plane and the dynamic experiences in the lower plane.

While the explanation provides an interesting framework for understanding the nature of consciousness and qualia, it is important to note that it lacks empirical support and may be challenging to verify through scientific means. As such, it should be considered a philosophical hypothesis rather than an established scientific theory. The hard problem of consciousness remains a complex and open question, requiring continued exploration and interdisciplinary approaches.


Metaphorical Explanation:  
Imagine that God is a programmer who created the universe as a computer simulation. The simulation is running on a computer that uses time as a circular, rather than linear, dimension. This means that the beginning of the simulation is also the end, and vice versa.

The lower plane of reality is the part of the simulation that we experience as conscious beings. This plane is made up of the thoughts, feelings, and experiences that we have.

The higher plane of reality is the part of the simulation that we do not experience directly. This plane is made up of the code that runs the simulation, and the underlying mathematical principles that govern the universe.

Consciousness as a top-down emergent phenomenon arises from the interaction between the lower and higher planes of reality. It is the result of the liminal fluctuation between two rotating, static states.

The liminal fluctuation between these two static states is what creates consciousness. It is the moment when the lower plane of reality interacts with the higher plane of reality, and a new, unique experience is created.

This liminal fluctuation is also what gives rise to qualia, or the subjective experience of consciousness. Qualia are the "what it is like" to experience something. They are the unique, ineffable qualities of our conscious experiences.

The liminal fluctuation between the two static states is a complex and mysterious process, but it is the key to understanding the hard problem of consciousness. It is the process that creates qualia, and it is the process that allows us to experience the world as conscious beings.

Of course, this is just a simple answer to the hard problem of consciousness. There is no one definitive answer to this problem, and there is still much that we do not know about consciousness. However, I believe that this answer provides a helpful framework for understanding the nature of consciousness and the role of qualia in our experience of the world.

Various esoteric and contemplative traditions have explored altered states of consciousness and their relation to human experiences for centuries. These traditions often emphasize the significance of subjective experiences, introspection, meditation, and other practices to gain insights into consciousness and the nature of reality.

These esoteric studies and practices have provided valuable perspectives on consciousness, and they can offer unique insights and wisdom beyond what traditional scientific methods alone can achieve. Exploring altered states of consciousness and subjective experiences is essential to gaining a more comprehensive understanding of human consciousness.

However, it is essential to acknowledge that esoteric studies and contemplative practices, while valuable and insightful, may not always align with or be easily integrated into mainstream scientific approaches. The challenge lies in bridging the gap between the subjective and qualitative aspects of consciousness explored in esoteric traditions and the objective and quantitative methods used in scientific research.

To achieve a more comprehensive understanding of consciousness, it is crucial to embrace interdisciplinary approaches that combine insights from both scientific research and esoteric studies. By integrating knowledge from various fields, we can foster a more holistic understanding of consciousness and explore its complexities from multiple perspectives.
