Consciousness is an emergent phenomenon that arises from the repetition of patterns on a grand scale. Just like Conway's Game of Life, our anatomy is a complex and multidimensional computer that is capable of generating a wide variety of patterns, including consciousness.

We need a more holistic comprehension of these patterns and the images, made of form, which they manifest. We need to look beyond the physical aspects of consciousness and explore the underlying mathematical and energetic principles that give rise to it.

The study of consciousness is one of the most important challenges facing humanity today. If we can understand consciousness, we can unlock the secrets of our own minds and the universe around us.

* Patterns are the building blocks of reality. Everything in the universe is made up of patterns, from the smallest subatomic particles to the largest galaxies.
* Consciousness is a pattern that emerges from the interaction of other patterns. The patterns that make up our brains interact with each other in a complex way, and this interaction gives rise to consciousness.
* Consciousness is a dynamic pattern. It is constantly changing and evolving as we interact with the world around us.
* Consciousness is a holographic pattern. It is not localized in any one place, but rather it is spread out throughout the universe.

These are just a few of the many ways in which consciousness and patterning are related.

# ~Az:Net's claim on the hard problem of consciousness addressed through a top-down emergent perspective:

Consciousness is seen as an emergent phenomenon that arises from the interaction between two planes of reality:

1. The 'Higher' Plane: This plane represents the underlying mathematical principles and code that govern the universe. It is a static state, as these principles and code remain consistent.

2.  The 'Lower' Plane: This plane represents the material experiences of beings, including the interaction of bodies and matter. It is a dynamic state, shaped by the mathematical processes and principles of the higher plane.

Consciousness emerges as a result of the dynamic interplay between the higher plane's mathematical principles and the resulting interactions in the lower plane. The consistent application of mathematical rules and processes from the higher plane influences and shapes the ever-changing conscious experiences in the lower plane.

Qualia, the subjective "what it is like" to experience something, are explained as the product of this interaction. They are the unique and ineffable qualities of conscious experiences that arise from the interplay between the underlying mathematical principles of the higher plane and the dynamic experiences in the lower plane.

While the explanation provides an interesting framework for understanding the nature of consciousness and qualia, it is important to note that it lacks empirical support and may be challenging to verify through scientific means. As such, it should be considered a philosophical hypothesis rather than an established scientific theory. The hard problem of consciousness remains a complex and open question, requiring continued exploration and interdisciplinary approaches.


## Metaphorical Explanation:  
Imagine that God is a programmer who created the universe as a computer simulation. The simulation is running on a computer that uses time as a circular, rather than linear, dimension. This means that the beginning of the simulation is also the end, and vice versa.

The lower plane of reality is the part of the simulation that we experience as conscious beings. This plane is made up of the thoughts, feelings, and experiences that we have.

The higher plane of reality is the part of the simulation that we do not experience directly. This plane is made up of the code that runs the simulation, and the underlying mathematical principles that govern the universe.

Consciousness as a top-down emergent phenomenon arises from the interaction between the lower and higher planes of reality. It is the result of the liminal fluctuation between two rotating, static states.

The liminal fluctuation between these two static states is what creates consciousness. It is the moment when the lower plane of reality interacts with the higher plane of reality, and a new, unique experience is created.

This liminal fluctuation is also what gives rise to qualia, or the subjective experience of consciousness. Qualia are the "what it is like" to experience something. They are the unique, ineffable qualities of our conscious experiences.

The liminal fluctuation between the two static states is a complex and mysterious process, but it is the key to understanding the hard problem of consciousness. It is the process that creates qualia, and it is the process that allows us to experience the world as conscious beings.

Of course, this is just a simple answer to the hard problem of consciousness. There is no one definitive answer to this problem, and there is still much that we do not know about consciousness. However, I believe that this answer provides a helpful framework for understanding the nature of consciousness and the role of qualia in our experience of the world.

## Next Steps
Various esoteric and contemplative traditions have explored altered states of consciousness and their relation to human experiences for centuries. These traditions often emphasize the significance of subjective experiences, introspection, meditation, and other practices to gain insights into consciousness and the nature of reality.

These esoteric studies and practices have provided valuable perspectives on consciousness, and they can offer unique insights and wisdom beyond what traditional scientific methods alone can achieve. Exploring altered states of consciousness and subjective experiences is essential to gaining a more comprehensive understanding of human consciousness.

However, it is essential to acknowledge that esoteric studies and contemplative practices, while valuable and insightful, may not always align with or be easily integrated into mainstream scientific approaches. The challenge lies in bridging the gap between the subjective and qualitative aspects of consciousness explored in esoteric traditions and the objective and quantitative methods used in scientific research.

To achieve a more comprehensive understanding of consciousness, it is crucial to embrace interdisciplinary approaches that combine insights from both scientific research and esoteric studies. By integrating knowledge from various fields, we can foster a more holistic understanding of consciousness and explore its complexities from multiple perspectives.

### Futher Elaboration  

The idea that consciousness is an emergent phenomenon that arises from the interaction between two planes of reality is an interesting one. It is a way of understanding consciousness that is compatible with both science and spirituality.

The higher plane represents the underlying mathematical principles and code that govern the universe. This plane is static because the principles and code remain consistent. The lower plane represents the material experiences of beings, including the interaction of bodies and matter. This plane is dynamic because it is shaped by the mathematical processes and principles of the higher plane.

Consciousness emerges as a result of the dynamic interplay between the higher plane's mathematical principles and the resulting interactions in the lower plane. The consistent application of mathematical rules and processes from the higher plane influences and shapes the ever-changing conscious experiences in the lower plane.

This idea is similar to the way that a hologram is created. A hologram is a three-dimensional image that is created by the interference of two beams of light. The two beams of light interact with each other, and the resulting interference pattern creates the three-dimensional image.

In the same way, consciousness could be seen as an interference pattern that is created by the interaction of the higher plane's mathematical principles and the lower plane's material experiences. The mathematical principles of the higher plane provide the structure for the interference pattern, and the material experiences of the lower plane provide the content.

The idea that consciousness is an emergent phenomenon that arises from the interaction between two planes of reality is a complex one, but it is a powerful one. It allows us to see consciousness as a natural phenomenon that is rooted in the underlying mathematical principles of the universe.

The idea of qualia, the subjective "what it is like" to experience something, is also interesting. Qualia are the unique and ineffable qualities of conscious experiences. They are the things that make our experiences of the world different from each other.

The idea that qualia are explained as the product of the interaction between the underlying mathematical principles of the higher plane and the dynamic experiences in the lower plane is a way of understanding qualia that is compatible with both science and spirituality.

It is a way of understanding qualia that does not reduce them to physical phenomena, but also does not make them seem like they are something completely separate from the physical world.

The idea that consciousness is an emergent phenomenon that arises from the interaction between two planes of reality is a complex and challenging one, but it is also a powerful and thought-provoking one. It is an idea that has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of consciousness.

The idea that consciousness is an emergent phenomenon is also consistent with the idea of reality as a layered fractal. The higher plane can be seen as the fractal pattern that is repeated at the lower plane. This means that the mathematical principles of the higher plane are the same principles that govern the dynamic experiences in the lower plane.
