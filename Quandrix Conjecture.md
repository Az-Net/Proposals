The Quandrix Conjecture states that for any natural sequence of infinitely-repeating decimals, a consistent pattern can be modeled.

This means that no matter how closely you examine the infinity, you will always find the same pattern repeating itself, even in chaotic functions like fractals.

* **Phi (Œ¶)**: The golden ratio, which is an irrational number approximately equal to 1.61803. It is often used in art and architecture to create aesthetically pleasing proportions.

* **e**: The base of the natural logarithm. Its decimal representation goes on forever without repeating and is approximately equal to 2.71828.

* **‚àö2**: The square root of 2. Its decimal representation goes on forever without repeating and is approximately equal to 1.41421.

* **e^œÄ**: The exponential of pi. Its decimal representation goes on forever without repeating and is approximately equal to 23.14069.

* **œÄ^e**: The exponential of e raised to the power of pi. Its decimal representation goes on forever without repeating and is approximately equal to 19.52849.

* **Log2**: The logarithm of 2 to the base 10. Its decimal representation goes on forever without repeating and is approximately equal to 0.30103.

* **Œì(1/2)**: The gamma function of 1/2. Its decimal representation goes on forever without repeating and is approximately equal to 1.77245.

* **Natural fractions**: Also known as vulgar fractions, these are fractions whose numerator and denominator are both natural numbers. In other words, they are fractions of the form a/b, where a and b are positive integers and b is not equal to 1. Examples of natural fractions include 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, and 5/7.
Natural fractions can be expressed in a variety of ways, including as repeating decimals, continued fractions, and infinite decimals. 


This conjecture has implications for our understanding of infinity and the nature of numbers. It suggests that even in the infinite, there is order and structure. If the conjecture is true, it could lead to new insights into the universe and our place in it.

The testable infinities listed provide a variety of examples where infinity can be meaningfully quantified and explored. These examples demonstrate that infinity is not a meaningless concept, but rather a rich and complex mathematical domain with its own unique properties.

If the Quandrix Conjecture is true, it could be used to develop new mathematical tools for modeling and understanding complex systems, such as the human brain or the universe itself. It could also lead to new insights into the nature of reality, such as whether there are fundamental laws of physics that govern the universe at all scales, including the infinite.

This hypothesis is extrapolated from the 'Vorzani Conjecture' of the Quandrix College at Strixhaven University on the plane of Arcavios.

Aka: MTG invented it, we made it real.
