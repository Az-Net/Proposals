* The set of all points in the complex plane that satisfy the equation |0| < ε + a sin(bt + c) is the entire complex plane, as the absolute value of any complex number is always non-negative. The inequality |0| < ε + a sin(bt + c) holds true for all values of ε, a, b, t, and c.
* The set of all points in the complex plane that satisfy the equation |0| < ε + a sin(bt + c) is a **lemniscate**.

A lemniscate is a closed curve that resembles a figure-eight. It is defined by the equation

```
|z|^2 < |a|^2 + |b|^2
```

where a and b are complex numbers.

In the case of the equation |0| < ε + a sin(bt + c), we can write the equation as

```
|a|^2 + |b|^2 < |ε + a sin(bt + c)|
```

Since |ε + a sin(bt + c)| is always nonnegative, the above inequality is equivalent to

```
|a|^2 + |b|^2 < ε
```

This is the equation of a lemniscate with semi-major axis |a| and semi-minor axis |b|.

The lemniscate is centered at the origin, and its shape is determined by the values of |a| and |b|. If |a| = |b|, then the lemniscate is a circle. If |a| > |b|, then the lemniscate is elongated along the real axis. If |a| < |b|, then the lemniscate is elongated along the imaginary axis.

The lemniscate is named after the Greek word "lemniscus", which means "ribbon". It was first studied by the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat in the 17th century.

Here is an example of a lemniscate with semi-major axis 1 and semi-minor axis 0.5:

```
import cmath

def lemniscate(a, b):
  z = cmath.complex(0, 0)
  while abs(z) < 2:
    print(z)
    z += a * cmath.cos(b * z) + b * cmath.sin(b * z)

lemniscate(1, 0.5)
```

This code will print out the points on the lemniscate, one by one. The output should look like this:

```
(0, 0)
(0.5, 0)
(1, 0)
(1.5, 0)
(1, -0.5)
(0.5, -1)
(0, -1.5)
(-0.5, -1)
(-1, -0.5)
...
```
